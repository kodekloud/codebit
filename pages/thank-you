					<h4>The power to choose your frameworks</h4>
					<p>
						From <a href="http://www.getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> to Foundation, angular.js to backbone.js... you are in control. The web has never been more powerful, don't let other "website builders" write sloppy, boring, innefficient code for you. Build the sites you want with the tools you want. Drag and drop in any JS or CSS frameworks you want and get down to the code.
					</p>
					<p>
						The web is changing....and fast. 3rd party Javascript libraries, CSS libraries and external services like Mail Chimp and Parse are redefining web development. Never have there been so many powerful tools to choose from when building a website. With CodeBit you have the power to import and integrate with any library you chose giving you and your visitors the best experience possible.
